O objetivo é ver a quantidade de sintomas e pesquisar a melhor forma de unir as bases, mantendo as características originais e evitando doenças com poucos casos. Após isso, serão estudadas as formas de junção!"

As associações foram calculadas para as 150 doenças mais frequentes, com base nessas notas clínicas, e os sintomas são apresentados em ordem de força da associação. O método utilizou o sistema de processamento de linguagem natural MedLEE para extrair códigos UMLS de doenças e sintomas a partir dos textos. Posteriormente, métodos estatísticos baseados em frequências e coocorrências foram empregados para calcular as associações. Uma descrição mais detalhada do método automatizado pode ser encontrada em: Wang X, Chused A, Elhadad N, Friedman C, Markatou M. Automated knowledge acquisition from clinical reports.

            "{'Panic Disorder': 'Symptoms of panic disorder often start in the late teens or early adulthood and affect more women than men. Factors that may increase the risk of developing panic attacks or panic disorder include: Family history of panic attacks or panic disorderMajor life stress, such as the death or serious illness of a loved oneA traumatic event, such as sexual assault or a serious accidentMajor changes in your life, such as a divorce or the addition of a babySmoking or excessive caffeine intakeHistory of childhood physical or sexual abuse', 'Turner Syndrome': \"The loss or alteration of the X chromosome occurs randomly. Sometimes, it's because of a problem with the sperm or the egg, and other times, the loss or alteration of the X chromosome happens early in fetal development. Family history doesn't seem to be a risk factor, so it's unlikely that parents of one child with Turner syndrome will have another child with the disorder.\", 'Cryptorchidism': 'Things that might raise the risk of an undescended testicle in a newborn include: Premature birth or low birth weight.Family history of undescended testicles.Health conditions in the baby, such as cerebral palsy or a problem with the wall of the abdomen.The mother having diabetes before or during pregnancy.Alcohol use during pregnancy.Smoking cigarettes or exposure to secondhand smoke during pregnancy.Exposure to some pesticides during pregnancy.', 'fracture of the hand': 'Your risk of a broken hand may be increased if you participate in sports like football, soccer, rugby, or hockey. Osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones, may also increase your risk of a broken hand.', 'Pyloric Stenosis': 'Pylorid stenosis is not a common condition. It is more likely in babies who: Are boys.Are first-born children.Were born prematurely.Have a family history of pyloric stenosis.Were born to a cigarette smoker.Were exposed to certain antibiotics late in the pregnancy or after birth.Are bottle-fed.', 'Metabolic Diseases': \"The following can increase the chances of having metabolic syndrome: Age.Risk of metabolic syndrome goes up with age. Ethnicity.In the United States, people who are Hispanic appear to be at the greatest risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Obesity.Carrying too much weight, especially around the stomach, increases the risk of metabolic syndrome. Diabetes.People who had diabetes during pregnancy, also known as gestational diabetes, are at greater risk of metabolic syndrome. That's also true of people who have a family history of type 2 diabetes. Other diseases.Other conditions linked to metabolic syndrome include steatotic liver disease, polycystic ovary syndrome and sleep apnea. Diet and exercise.People who eat an unhealthy diet and don't get enough physical activity are at higher risk of metabolic syndrome.\", 'Vaginitis': 'Factors that increase the risk of developing vaginitis include: Hormonal changes, such as those associated with pregnancy, birth control pills or menopause Sexual activity Having a sexually transmitted infection Medications, such as antibiotics and steroids Use of spermicides for birth control Uncontrolled diabetes Use of hygiene products such as bubble bath, vaginal spray or vaginal deodorant Douching Wearing damp or tight-fitting clothing Using an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control', 'Sick Sinus Syndrome': \"Sick sinus syndrome can occur at any age. It's most common in people in their 70s or older. Common heart disease risk factors might increase the risk of sick sinus syndrome. Risk factors for heart disease include: High blood pressure High cholesterol Excess body weight Lack of exercise\", 'Glaucoma': 'Glaucoma can damage vision before you notice any symptoms. So be aware of these risk factors: High internal eye pressure, also known as intraocular pressure.Age over 55.Black, Asian or Hispanic heritage.Family history of glaucoma.Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, migraine, high blood pressure and sickle cell anemia.Corneas that are thin in the center.Extreme nearsightedness or farsightedness.Eye injury or certain types of eye surgery.Taking corticosteroid medicines, especially eye drops, for a long time. Some people have narrow drainage angles, putting them at increased risk of angle-closure glaucoma.', 'Eating Disorders': \"Binge-eating disorder is more common in women than in men. People of any age can have binge-eating disorder, but it often begins in the late teens or early 20s. Factors that can raise your risk of having binge-eating disorder include: Family history.You're much more likely to have an eating disorder if your parents or siblings have — or had — an eating disorder. This may point to genes passed down in your family that increase the risk of having an eating disorder.Dieting.Many people with binge-eating disorder have a history of dieting. Dieting or limiting calories throughout the day may trigger an urge to binge eat.Mental health conditions.Many people who have binge-eating disorder feel negatively about themselves and their skills and accomplishments. Triggers for bingeing can include stress, poor body self-image and certain foods. Certain situations also can be triggers, for example, being at a party, having downtime or driving in your car.\", 'Transient Ischemic Attack': \"Some risk factors of a transient ischemic attack and stroke can't be changed. Others you can control. Risk factors you can't change You can't change these risk factors of aTIAand stroke. But knowing you have these risks can motivate you to change the risk factors you can control. Family history.Your risk may be greater if one of your family members has had aTIAor a stroke.Age.Your risk increases as you get older, especially after age 55.Sex.Men have a slightly higher risk of aTIAand a stroke. But as women age, their risk of a stroke goes up.Prior transient ischemic attack.If you've had one or moreTIAs, you're much more likely to have a stroke.Sickle cell disease.Stroke is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, also known as sickle cell anemia. Sickle-shaped blood cells carry less oxygen and also tend to get stuck in artery walls, affecting blood flow to the brain. But with proper treatment of sickle cell disease, you can lower your risk of a stroke. Risk factors you can control You can control or treat a number of risk factors of aTIAand a stroke, including certain health conditions and lifestyle choices. Having one or more of these risk factors doesn't mean you'll have a stroke, but your risk increases if you have two or more of them. Health conditions High blood pressure.The risk of a stroke begins to increase at blood pressure readings of 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and higher. Your healthcare professional can help you decide on a target blood pressure based on your age and other factors, such as whether you have diabetes.High cholesterol.Eating less cholesterol and fat, especially saturated fat and trans fat, may reduce the plaques in your arteries. If you can't control your cholesterol through dietary changes alone, your provider may prescribe a statin or another type of cholesterol-lowering medicine.Cardiovascular disease.This includes heart failure, a heart defect, a heart infection or a heart rhythm condition.Carotid artery disease.In this condition, the blood vessels in the neck that lead to the brain become clogged.Peripheral artery disease (PAD).PADcauses the blood vessels that carry blood to the arms and legs to become clogged.Diabetes.Diabetes speeds up and worsens the narrowing of arteries due to a buildup of fatty deposits, known as atherosclerosis.High levels of homocysteine.Elevated levels of this amino acid in the blood can cause the arteries to thicken and scar. This makes them more susceptible to clots.Excess weight.Obesity, especially carrying extra weight in the stomach, increases stroke risk.COVID-19.There is evidence that the virus that causesCOVID-19may raise the risk of stroke. Lifestyle choices Cigarette smoking.Smoking increases the risk of blood clots, raises blood pressure and plays a part in the development of atherosclerosis. But quitting smoking lowers the risk of having aTIAor a stroke.Physical inactivity.Engaging in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days helps lower risk.Poor nutrition.Eating less fat and salt decreases the risk of aTIAand a stroke.Heavy drinking.If you drink alcohol, limit yourself to up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.Use of illicit drugs.Avoid cocaine and other illicit drugs.\", 'Pyelonephritis': \"Factors that increase the risk of a kidney infection include: Being female.The urethra is shorter in women than in men. That makes it easier for bacteria to travel from outside the body to the bladder. The urethra being close to the vagina and anus also makes it easier for bacteria to enter the bladder.Once in the bladder, an infection can spread to the kidneys. Pregnant women are at even higher risk of a kidney infection.Having a urinary tract blockage.Anything that slows the flow of urine or makes it harder to fully empty the bladder can raise the risk of a kidney infection. This includes a kidney stone, a narrowed urethra or an enlarged prostate gland.Having a weakened immune system.Medical conditions such as diabetes and HIV can weaken the immune system. Certain medicines also can lower immunity. These include drugs taken after an organ transplant that help prevent rejection.Having damage to nerves around the bladder.Nerve or spinal cord damage can block the feeling of a bladder infection. That can make it hard to know when an infection travels to a kidney.Using a urinary catheter.Urinary catheters are tubes used to drain urine from the bladder. Catheters are sometimes used after a surgical procedure or diagnostic test. They're also used in people who are confined to a bed.Having a condition that causes urine to flow the wrong way.In vesicoureteral reflux, small amounts of urine flow from the bladder back into the tubes that connect the bladder and kidneys. People with this condition are at higher risk of kidney infections when they're kids and when they become adults.\", 'Rotator Cuff Injuries': 'The following factors may increase the risk of having a rotator cuff injury: Age.The risk of a rotator cuff injury increases with age. Rotator cuff tears are most common in people older than 50.Some occupations.Jobs that require repetitive overhead arm motions, such as carpentry or house painting, can damage the rotator cuff over time.Certain sports.Some types of rotator cuff injuries are more common in people who participate in sports such as baseball, tennis and weightlifting.Family history.There may be a genetic component involved with rotator cuff injuries as they appear to occur more commonly in certain families.', 'Atelectasis': 'Factors that make you more likely to get atelectasis include: Any condition that makes it hard to swallow.Needing to stay in bed over a long time and not having enough changes of position.Lung disease, such as asthma, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis.Recent surgery in the stomach area or chest.Recent general anesthesia.Weak breathing muscles due to muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injury or another neuromuscular condition.Medicines that may cause weak breathing.Pain or injury that may make it painful to cough or cause weak breathing, including stomach pain or a broken rib.Smoking.', 'Liver Cirrhosis': \"Drinking too much alcohol.Alcohol abuse is a risk factor for cirrhosis.Being overweight.Being obese increases the risk of conditions that may lead to cirrhosis. These conditions include metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, formerly called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, formerly called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.Having viral hepatitis.Not everyone with chronic hepatitis will develop cirrhosis, but it's one of the world's leading causes of liver disease.\", 'Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic': \"Anything that damages or weakens blood vessels may raise the risk of an aneurysm. Thoracic aortic aneurysm risk factors include: Age.Thoracic aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 65 and older.Smoking and tobacco use.If you smoke or chew tobacco, it's important that you quit. Using tobacco also can worsen an aneurysm and overall health.High blood pressure.Increased blood pressure damages the blood vessels in the body. This raises the risk of an aneurysm.Coronary artery disease.This type of heart disease causes reduced blood flow to the heart. It's often caused by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can damage the lining of a blood vessel, increasing the risk of an aneurysm. This is a more common risk in older people.Family history.You're more likely to get an aortic aneurysm and rupture if you have a parent, brother, sister or child with one. You may develop aneurysms at a younger age. If you're at risk of an aortic aneurysm, you might get medicines to lower your blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries.\", 'Diabetic Retinopathy': 'Anyone who has diabetes can develop diabetic retinopathy. The risk of developing the eye condition can increase as a result of: Having diabetes for a long time Poor control of your blood sugar level High blood pressure High cholesterol Pregnancy Tobacco use Being Black, Hispanic or Native American', 'Fibromyalgia': 'Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: Being assigned female at birth.Fibromyalgia is more common in women than in men. Family history.You may be more likely to get fibromyalgia if a parent or sibling also has the condition. Other medical conditions.Your risk of fibromyalgia rises if you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or obesity.', 'fetal alcohol syndrome': \"The more alcohol you drink during pregnancy, the greater the chance of problems in your baby. There's no known safe amount of alcohol to drink during pregnancy, and there's no type of alcohol that is safe. You could put your baby at risk even before you realize you're pregnant. Don't drink alcohol if: You're pregnant.You think you might be pregnant.You're trying to become pregnant.\", 'Peritonitis': \"Some things that raise the risk of peritonitis are: Peritoneal dialysis.Peritonitis can happen in people who get this treatment.Other medical conditions.Certain conditions raise your risk of getting peritonitis, such as:Liver cirrhosis.Appendicitis.Stomach ulcers.Diverticulitis.Crohn's disease.Pancreatitis.History of peritonitis.Once you've had peritonitis, your risk of getting it again may be higher than that of someone who's never had it.\", 'Thrombophlebitis': \"Your risk of thrombophlebitis is higher if you're not active for a long period or you have a catheter in a central vein to treat a condition. Having varicose veins or a pacemaker can also increase your risk. Women who are pregnant, have just given birth, or take birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy may also be at higher risk. Other risk factors include a family history of a blood-clotting disorder, a tendency to form blood clots, and having thrombophlebitis before. Your risk may also be higher if you've had a stroke, you're over age 60, or you're overweight. Having cancer and smoking are also risk factors. Your risk of thrombophlebitis might increase if you: If you have one or more risk factors, discuss prevention strategies with your doctor before taking long flights or road trips or if you're planning to have elective surgery, recovery from which will require you not to move much. Are inactive for a prolonged period, either because you're confined to bed or you're traveling in a car or plane for a long period Have varicose veins, which are a common cause of superficial thrombophlebitis Have a pacemaker or have a thin, flexible tube (catheter) in a central vein, for treatment of a medical condition, which may irritate the blood vessel wall and decrease blood flow Are pregnant or have just given birth Use birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy, which can make your blood more likely to clot Have a family history of a blood-clotting disorder or a tendency to form blood clots Have had previous episodes of thrombophlebitis Have had a stroke Are older than 60 Are overweight or obese Have cancer Smoke\", 'Asthma': \"The more you're exposed to an irritant, the greater the risk of developing occupational asthma. In addition, you will have increased risk if: You have existing allergies or asthma.Although this can increase your risk, many people who have allergies or asthma do jobs that expose them to lung irritants and never have symptoms.Other family members have allergies or asthma.Your parents may pass down genes that make it more likely for you to develop asthma.You work around known asthma triggers.Some substances are known to be lung irritants and asthma triggers.You smoke.Smoking increases your risk of developing asthma if you are exposed to certain types of irritants. High-risk jobs It's possible to develop occupational asthma in almost any workplace. But your risk is higher in certain workplaces. Some of the riskiest jobs linked to asthma-producing substances include the following: JobsAsthma-producing substancesAdhesive handlersChemicalsAnimal handlers, veterinariansAnimal proteinsBakers, millers, farmersCereal grainsCarpet-makersVegetable gumsMetalworkersCobalt, nickelFood production workersMilk powder, egg powderForest workers, carpenters, cabinetmakersWood dustHairdressersDyesHealthcare workersLatex and chemicalsPharmaceutical workers, bakersDrugs, enzymesSeafood processorsHerring, snow crabSpray painters, insulation installers, plastics and foam industry workers, welders, metalworkers, chemical manufacturers, shellac handlersChemicalsTextile workersDyes, plasticsUsers of plastics or epoxy resins, chemical manufacturersChemicals\", 'Restless Legs Syndrome': \"Restless legs syndrome can develop at any age, even during childhood. The condition is more common with increasing age. It's also more common in women than in men. RLSusually isn't related to a serious underlying medical condition. However, it sometimes occurs with other conditions, such as: Peripheral neuropathy.This damage to the nerves in the hands and feet is sometimes due to chronic diseases such as diabetes and alcohol use disorder.Iron deficiency.Too little iron in the body, known as iron deficiency, can cause or worsenRLS. People who have a history of bleeding from the stomach or bowels may have iron deficiency. Deficiency also may affect people who have heavy menstrual periods or who often donate blood.Kidney failure.If you have kidney failure, you also may have iron deficiency, often with anemia. When kidneys don't function properly, iron stores in the blood can decrease. This and other changes in body chemistry may cause or worsenRLS.Spinal cord conditions.Damage to or injury of the spinal cord has been linked toRLS.Parkinson's disease.People who have Parkinson's disease may have an increased risk of developingRLS.\", 'Acute sinusitis': 'The following can raise the risk of getting sinusitis: Hay fever or another allergythat affects the sinuses.A common coldthat affects the sinuses.A problem inside the nose,such as a deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps or tumors.A medical conditionsuch as cystic fibrosis or an immune system disorder such as HIV/AIDS.Being around smoke,either from smoking or being around others who smoke, known as secondhand smoke.', 'Depression, Postpartum': \"Any new mom can experience postpartum depression and it can develop after the birth of any child, not just the first.

Maternal health Certain infections or toxic exposures during pregnancy can significantly increase cerebral palsy risk to the baby. Inflammation triggered by infection or fever can damage the unborn baby\\'s developing brain. Cytomegalovirus.This common virus causes flu-like symptoms. If a mother has her first active infection during pregnancy, it can lead to birth defects.German measles, known as rubella.This viral infection can be prevented with a vaccine.Herpes.This infection can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy, affecting the womb and placenta.Syphilis.This is a bacterial infection that\\'s usually spread by sexual contact.Toxoplasmosis.This infection is caused by a parasite found in contaminated food, soil and the feces of infected cats.Zika virus infection.This infection is spread through mosquito bites and can affect the brain development of an unborn baby.Intrauterine infections.This includes infections of the placenta or fetal membranes.Exposure to toxins.One example is exposure to methyl mercury.Other conditions.Other conditions affecting the mother that can slightly increase the risk of cerebral palsy include thyroid conditions, preeclampsia or seizures. Infant illness Illnesses in a newborn baby that can greatly increase the risk of cerebral palsy include: Bacterial meningitis.This bacterial infection causes swelling in the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.Viral encephalitis.This viral infection also causes swelling in the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.Severe or untreated jaundice.Jaundice appears as a yellowing of the skin and eyes. The condition occurs when certain byproducts of \"used\" blood cells aren\\'t filtered from the bloodstream.Bleeding into the brain.This condition is commonly caused by the baby having a stroke in the womb or in early infancy. Factors of pregnancy and birth The potential contribution from each is limited, but these pregnancy and birth factors may increase the risk of cerebral palsy risk: Low birth weight.Babies who weigh less than 5.5 pounds (2.5 kilograms) are at higher risk of developing cerebral palsy. This risk increases as birth weight drops.Multiple babies.Cerebral palsy risk increases with the number of babies sharing the uterus. The risk also can be related to the likelihood of premature birth and low birth weight. If one or more of the babies die, the survivors\\' risk of cerebral palsy increases.Premature birth.Babies born prematurely are at higher risk of cerebral palsy. The earlier a baby is born, the greater the cerebral palsy risk.Delivery complications.Events during labor and delivery may increase the risk of cerebral palsy.', 'Obesity': \"Obesity often results from a combination of causes and contributing factors: Family inheritance and influences The genes you inherit from your parents may affect the amount of body fat you store, and where that fat is distributed. Genetics also may play a role in how efficiently your body converts food into energy, how your body regulates your appetite and how your body burns calories during exercise. Obesity tends to run in families. That's not just because of the genes they share. Family members also tend to share similar eating and activity habits. Lifestyle choices Unhealthy diet.A diet that's high in calories, lacking in fruits and vegetables, full of fast food, and laden with high-calorie beverages and oversized portions contributes to weight gain.Liquid calories.People can drink many calories without feeling full, especially calories from alcohol. Other high-calorie beverages, such as sugared soft drinks, can contribute to weight gain.Inactivity.If you have an inactive lifestyle, you can easily take in more calories every day than you burn through exercise and routine daily activities. Looking at computer, tablet and phone screens is inactivity. The number of hours spent in front of a screen is highly associated with weight gain. Certain diseases and medications In some people, obesity can be traced to a medical cause, such as hypothyroidism, Cushing syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome and other conditions. Medical problems, such as arthritis, also can lead to decreased activity, which may result in weight gain. Some medicines can lead to weight gain if you don't compensate through diet or activity. These medicines include steroids, some antidepressants, anti-seizure medicines, diabetes medicines, antipsychotic medicines and certain beta blockers. Social and economic issues Social and economic factors are linked to obesity. It's hard to avoid obesity if you don't have safe areas to walk or exercise. You may not have learned healthy ways of cooking. Or you may not have access to healthier foods. Also, the people you spend time with may influence your weight. You're more likely to develop obesity if you have friends or relatives with obesity. Age Obesity can occur at any age, even in young children. But as you age, hormonal changes and a less active lifestyle increase your risk of obesity. The amount of muscle in your body also tends to decrease with age. Lower muscle mass often leads to a decrease in metabolism. These changes also reduce calorie needs and can make it harder to keep off excess weight. If you don't consciously control what you eat and become more physically active as you age, you'll likely gain weight. Other factors Pregnancy.Weight gain is common during pregnancy. Some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born. This weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women.Quitting smoking.Quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain. And for some, it can lead to enough weight gain to qualify as obesity. Often, this happens as people use food to cope with smoking withdrawal. But overall, quitting smoking is still a greater benefit to your health than is continuing to smoke. Your health care team can help you prevent weight gain after quitting smoking.Lack of sleep.Not getting enough sleep can cause changes in hormones that increase appetite. So can getting too much sleep. You also may crave foods high in calories and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain.Stress.Many external factors that affect mood and well-being may contribute to obesity. People often seek more high-calorie food during stressful situations.Microbiome.The make-up of your gut bacteria is affected by what you eat and may contribute to weight gain or trouble losing weight. Even if you have one or more of these risk factors, it doesn't mean that you're destined to develop obesity. You can counteract most risk factors through diet, physical activity and exercise. Behavior changes, medicines and procedures for obesity also can help.\", 'Dyspepsia': 'Some factors can increase the risk of functional dyspepsia.

If you have tuberous sclerosis, you have up to a 50% chance of passing the changed gene and the disorder to your biological children, which means children related to you by blood may inherit that gene. How bad the disorder gets may vary. A parent with tuberous sclerosis may have a child who has a milder or a more severe form of the disorder.', 'Presbycusis': 'Factors that damage or lead to loss of the hairs and nerve cells in the inner ear include: Aging.The inner ear breaks down over time.Loud noise.Being around loud sounds can damage the cells of the inner ear. Damage can happen by being around loud noises over time. Or the damage can come from a short blast of noise, such as from a gunshot.Heredity.Your genes may make you more likely to have ear damage from sound or from aging.Noises on the job.Jobs where loud noise is constant, such as farming, construction or factory work, can lead to damage inside the ear.Noises at play.Exposure to explosive noises, such as from firearms and jet engines, can cause immediate, permanent hearing loss. Other activities with dangerously high noise levels include snowmobiling, motorcycling, carpentry or listening to loud music.Some medicines.These include the antibiotic gentamicin, sildenafil (Viagra) and certain medicines used to treat cancer, which can damage the inner ear. Very high doses of aspirin, other pain relievers, antimalarial drugs or loop diuretics can cause short-term effects on hearing.

Premature babies also may feed less and have fewer bowel movements, resulting in less bilirubin eliminated through stool. Significant bruising during birth.Newborns who become bruised during delivery gets bruises from the delivery may have higher levels of bilirubin from the breakdown of more red blood cells. Blood type.If the mother's blood type is different from her baby's, the baby may have received antibodies through the placenta that cause abnormally rapid breakdown of red blood cells. Breast-feeding.Breast-fed babies, particularly those who have difficulty nursing or getting enough nutrition from breast-feeding, are at higher risk of jaundice. Dehydration or a low caloric intake may contribute to the onset of jaundice. However, because of the benefits of breast-feeding, experts still recommend it. It's important to make sure your baby gets enough to eat and is adequately hydrated. Race.Studies show that babies of East Asian ancestry have an increased risk of developing jaundice.\", 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd)': 'Risk factors for COPD include: Tobacco smoke.The biggest risk factor for COPD is long-term cigarette smoking.

Asthma may be a risk factor for developing COPD. The mix of asthma and smoking raises the risk of COPD even more.Workplace exposure.Long-term exposure to chemical fumes, smoke, vapors and dusts in the workplace can irritate and cause swelling in the lungs. This can raise the risk of COPD.Fumes from burning fuel.In the developing world, people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in homes with poor airflow are at higher risk of COPD.Genetics.AAT deficiency caused by a gene change passed down in families is the cause of COPD in some people.

The more risk factors you have, the greater your risk of DVT. Risk factors for DVT\\xa0include: Sometimes, a blood clot in a vein can occur with no identifiable risk factor. This is called an unprovoked\\xa0venous thromboembolism. Age.Being older than 60 increases the risk of DVT. But DVT\\xa0can occur at any age. Lack of movement.When the legs don't move for a long time, the calf muscles don't squeeze (contract). Muscle contractions help blood flow. Sitting for a long time, such as when driving or flying, increases the risk of DVT. So does long-term bed rest, which may result from a lengthy hospital stay or a medical condition such as paralysis. Injury or surgery.Injury to the veins or surgery can increase the risk of blood clots. Pregnancy.Pregnancy increases the pressure in the veins in the pelvis and legs. The risk of blood clots from pregnancy can continue for up to six weeks after a baby is born. People with an inherited clotting disorder are especially at risk. Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) or hormone replacement therapy.Both can increase the blood's ability to clot. Being overweight or obese.Being overweight increases the pressure in the veins in the pelvis and legs. Smoking.Smoking affects how blood flows and clots, which can increase the risk of DVT. Cancer.Some cancers increase substances in the blood that cause the blood to clot. Some types of cancer treatment also increase the risk of blood clots. Heart failure.Heart failure increases the risk of DVT\\xa0and pulmonary embolism. Because the heart and lungs don't work well in people with heart failure, the symptoms caused by even a small pulmonary embolism are more noticeable.

These include: Family history.If a family member has Peyronie disease, you have a higher risk of the condition.Connective tissue diseases.People who have certain conditions that affect connective tissue in the body seem to have a higher risk of getting Peyronie disease. For example, some people with Peyronie disease also have a thick cord under the skin of the palm that can pull the fingers inward. This is called Dupuytren contracture.Age.Peyronie disease can happen at any age. But it becomes more common between the ages of 45 and 70. Curving of the penis in younger men less often is due to Peyronie disease. It is more commonly called congenital penile curvature.

A medical professional can see them through a thin, flexible tube, called an endoscope, passed down the throat. These marks suggest a high risk of bleeding.Severe cirrhosis or liver failure.Most often, the more serious the liver disease, the more likely esophageal varices are to bleed.Continued alcohol use.The risk of variceal bleeding is far greater for people who continue to drink, especially if the disease is alcohol related. If someone had bleeding from esophageal varices before, they're more likely to have varices that bleed again.\", 'Cystic Fibrosis': \"Because cystic fibrosis is a condition passed down in families, family history is a risk factor. CF occurs in all races, but it's most common in white people of Northern European ancestry. Because it's less common in people who are Black, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Native American or Asian, this might lead to a much later diagnosis. A late diagnosis may cause worse health issues.

The more you smoke, the greater the risk.', 'Carpal Tunnel Syndrome': \"Several factors have been linked with carpal tunnel syndrome. Although they may not directly cause carpal tunnel syndrome, they may increase the risk of irritation or damage to the median nerve. These include: Anatomical factors.A wrist fracture or dislocation can alter the space within the carpal tunnel. Arthritis that causes changes to the small bones in the wrist can affect the carpal tunnel. These changes can put pressure on the median nerve.People who have smaller carpal tunnels may be more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome.Sex assigned at birth.Carpal tunnel syndrome is generally more common in women. This may be because the carpal tunnel area is relatively smaller in women than in men. Or it may be due to the effect of hormones on the lining of the tendons in the carpal tunnel.Women who have carpal tunnel syndrome also may have smaller carpal tunnels than do women who don't have the condition.Nerve-damaging conditions.Some chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, increase the risk of nerve damage, including damage to the median nerve.Inflammatory conditions.Rheumatoid arthritis, gout and other conditions that cause swelling, known as inflammation, can affect the lining around the tendons in the wrist. This can put pressure on the median nerve.Medicines.Some studies have shown a link between carpal tunnel syndrome and anastrozole (Arimidex), a medicine used to treat breast cancer.Obesity.Being obese is a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome.Body fluid changes.Fluid retention may increase the pressure within the carpal tunnel, irritating the median nerve. This is common during pregnancy and menopause. Carpal tunnel syndrome that happens with pregnancy generally gets better on its own after pregnancy.Other medical conditions.Certain conditions, such as thyroid disorders, kidney failure and lymphedema, may increase the chances of getting carpal tunnel syndrome.Workplace factors.Working with vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires repeated movements that flex the wrist may create pressure on the median nerve. Such work also may worsen existing nerve damage. Pressure on the nerve can be worse if the work is done in a cold environment.However, the scientific evidence is conflicting and these factors haven't been established as direct causes of carpal tunnel syndrome.Several studies have evaluated whether there is a link between computer use and carpal tunnel syndrome. Some evidence suggests that mouse use, but not the use of a keyboard, may be related to carpal tunnel syndrome. There has not been enough quality and consistent evidence to support extensive computer use as a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome.

Head and neck cancers include cancers that start in the mouth, throat, sinuses and salivary glands. In general, things that increase the risk of head and neck cancers include: Using tobacco.Using tobacco of any kind increases the risk of many types of head and neck cancer. Examples of kinds of tobacco include cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco and snuff.Drinking alcohol.Frequent and heavy drinking increases the risk of many types of head and neck cancer.Being exposed to human papillomavirus, also called HPV.HPV is a common virus that's passed through sexual contact. For most people, it causes no problems and goes away on its own. For others, it can cause changes in cells that can lead to many types of cancer. Many throat cancers are thought to be caused by HPV.Breathing chemicals in the air.Exposure to chemicals in the air can increase the risk of cancer in the nose and sinuses. Chemicals at home and at work can increase the risk.Being exposed to the sun or tanning lamps.Ultraviolet light from the sun increases the risk of skin cancer of the head and neck. Ultraviolet light also can come from the lights used in tanning beds.\", 'Goiter': \"Anyone can develop a goiter. It may be present at birth or occur at any time throughout life. Some common risk factors for goiters include: A lack of dietary iodine.Iodine is found primarily in seawater and in the soil in coastal areas.

Being female.Women are more likely to develop a goiter or other thyroid disorders. Pregnancy and menopause.Thyroid problems in women are more likely to occur during pregnancy and menopause. Age.Goiters are more common after age 40. Family medical history.Family medical history of goiters or other thyroid disorders increases the risk of goiters. Also, researchers have identified genetic factors that may be associated with an increased risk. Medications.Some medical treatments, including the heart drug amiodarone (Pacerone) and the psychiatric drug lithium (Lithobid), increase your risk. Radiation exposure.Your risk increases if you've had radiation treatments to your neck or chest area.\", 'urge incontinence': \"Aging increases the risk of overactive bladder. So does being female. Conditions such as enlarged prostate and diabetes also can increase the risk. Many people with declines in thinking ability, such as those who have had a stroke or have Alzheimer's disease, get an overactive bladder. That's because they're less able to notice the symptoms of needing to urinate. Drinking fluids on a schedule, timing and prompting urination, absorbent garments, and bowel programs can help manage the condition. Some people with an overactive bladder also have trouble with bowel control. Tell your healthcare professional if you're having trouble controlling your bowels.\", 'Muscular Dystrophy': 'Muscular dystrophy occurs in people of all ages and ethnic groups.

Genetic mutations.Certain genetic mutations might increase your risk of developing optic neuritis or multiple sclerosis.', 'Meningioma': 'Risk factors for a meningioma include: Radiation treatment.Radiation therapy that involves the head may increase the risk of a meningioma.Female hormones.Meningiomas are more common in women. This might mean that female hormones may play a role. Some studies also have suggested a link between breast cancer and meningioma risk related to the role of hormones. Some research suggests that the use of oral birth control and hormone replacement therapy could raise the risk of meningioma growth.An inherited nervous system condition.The rare condition neurofibromatosis 2 increases the risk of meningioma and other brain tumors.Obesity.A high body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for many types of cancers. Several large studies have found that meningiomas happen more often in obese people. But the link between obesity and meningiomas is not clear.', 'placental abruption': \"Factors that can increase the risk of placental abruption include: Placental abruption in a previous pregnancy that wasn't caused by abdominal trauma Chronic high blood pressure (hypertension) Hypertension-related problems during pregnancy, including preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome or eclampsia A fall or other type of blow to the abdomen Smoking Cocaine use during pregnancy Early rupture of membranes, which causes leaking amniotic fluid before the end of pregnancy Infection inside of the uterus during pregnancy (chorioamnionitis) Being older, especially older than 40\", 'seasonal allergies (hay fever)': \"The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever: Having other allergies or asthma.Having a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.Having a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.Living or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.Being exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.Having a mother who smoked during the first year of life.\", 'Uterine Cancer': \"Female reproductive systemEnlarge imageCloseFemale reproductive systemFemale reproductive systemThe ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina, also called the vaginal canal, make up the female reproductive system. Factors that increase the risk of endometrial cancer include: Changes in the balance of hormones in the body.The two main hormones the ovaries make are estrogen and progesterone. Changes in the balance of these hormones cause changes in the endometrium.A disease or condition that increases the amount of estrogen, but not the level of progesterone, in the body can increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Examples include obesity, diabetes and irregular ovulation patterns, which might happen in polycystic ovary syndrome. Taking hormone therapy medicine that contains estrogen but not progestin after menopause increases the risk of endometrial cancer.A rare type of ovarian tumor that gives off estrogen also can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.More years of menstruation.Starting menstruation before age 12 or beginning menopause later increases the risk of endometrial cancer. The more periods you've had, the more exposure your endometrium has had to estrogen.Never having been pregnant.If you've never been pregnant, you have a higher risk of endometrial cancer than someone who has had at least one pregnancy.Older age.As you get older, your risk of endometrial cancer increases. Endometrial cancer occurs most often after menopause.Obesity.Being obese increases your risk of endometrial cancer. This may happen because extra body fat can alter your body's balance of hormones.Hormone therapy for breast cancer.Taking the hormone therapy medicine tamoxifen for breast cancer can increase the risk of developing endometrial cancer. If you're taking tamoxifen, talk about the risk with your health care team. For most, the benefits of tamoxifen outweigh the small risk of endometrial cancer.An inherited syndrome that increases the risk of cancer.Lynch syndrome increases the risk of colon cancer and other cancers, including endometrial cancer. Lynch syndrome is caused by a DNA change that's passed from parents to children. If a family member has been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, ask your health care team about your risk of this genetic syndrome. If you've been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, ask what cancer screenings you need.\", 'Dental abscess': 'These factors may increase your risk of a tooth abscess: Poor dental habits and care.Not taking proper care of your teeth and gums — such as not brushing your teeth twice a day and not flossing — can increase your risk of dental problems. Problems may include tooth decay, gum disease, tooth abscess, and other dental and mouth complications. A diet high in sugar.Frequently eating and drinking foods rich in sugar, such as sweets and sodas, can contribute to dental cavities and turn into a tooth abscess. Dry mouth.Having a dry mouth can increase your risk of tooth decay. Dry mouth is often due to the side effect of certain medications or issues related to aging.', 'Rectal Diseases': \"Risk factors for proctitis include: Unsafe sex.Practices that increase your risk of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) can increase your risk of proctitis. Your risk of contracting an sexually transmitted infection (STI) increases if you have multiple sex partners, don't use condoms and have sex with a partner who has anSTI. Inflammatory bowel diseases.Having an inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis ) increases your risk of proctitis. Radiation therapy for cancer.Radiation therapy directed at or near your rectum (such as for rectal, ovarian or prostate cancer) increases your risk of proctitis.\", 'Sarcoidosis': \"While anyone can develop sarcoidosis, factors that may raise your risk include: Age and sex.Sarcoidosis can happen at any age, but often occurs between the ages of 20 and 60 years. Women are slightly more likely to develop the condition than are men.Race.Sarcoidosis occurs more often in people of African descent and those of Northern European descent.

Hemochromatosis is less common in people of Black, Hispanic and Asian ancestry.Sex.Men are more likely than women to develop symptoms of hemochromatosis at an earlier age. Because women lose iron through menstruation and pregnancy, they tend to store less of the mineral than men do. After menopause or a hysterectomy, the risk increases for women.', 'Cushing Syndrome': '', 'Typhoid Fever': \"Typhoid fever is a serious worldwide threat and affects millions of people each year. Places with the highest number of cases or with regular outbreaks are in Africa and South Asia. But cases are recorded worldwide, often due to travelers to and from these areas. If you live in a country where typhoid fever is rare, you're at increased risk if you: Work in or travel to areas where typhoid fever is established, especially if you travel to visit family or friends. People visiting loved ones may have higher social pressure to drink or eat foods that present a higher risk. Work as a clinical microbiologist handling Salmonella enterica serotype typhi bacteria. Have close contact with someone who is infected or has recently been infected with typhoid fever.\", 'Aspergillosis': 'Your risk of developing aspergillosis depends on your overall health and the extent of your exposure to mold. In general, these factors make you more vulnerable to infection: Weakened immune system.People taking immune-suppressing drugs after undergoing transplant surgery — especially bone marrow or stem cell transplants — or people who have certain cancers of the blood are at highest risk of invasive aspergillosis. People in the later stages of AIDS also may be at increased risk. Low white blood cell level.People who have had chemotherapy, an organ transplant or leukemia have lower white cell levels, making them more susceptible to invasive aspergillosis. So does having chronic granulomatous disease — an inherited disorder that affects immune system cells. Lung cavities.People who have air spaces (cavities) in their lungs are at higher risk of developing aspergillomas. Asthma or cystic fibrosis.People with asthma and cystic fibrosis, especially those whose lung problems are long-standing or hard to control, are more likely to have an allergic response to aspergillus mold. Long-term corticosteroid therapy.Long-term use of corticosteroids may increase the risk of opportunistic infections, depending on the underlying disease being treated and what other drugs are being used.', 'whooping cough': \"The whooping cough vaccine you receive as a child wears off over time. This leaves many teenagers and adults prone to the infection during an outbreak. And regular outbreaks still happen. Certain infants are most at risk for serious health problems and death from whooping cough. These include babies younger than 12 months old who are not vaccinated or haven't received all their vaccine doses.\", \"Alzheimer's Disease\": \"Risk factors for Alzheimer's disease include age, family history, lifestyle and other factors. Older age Older age is the strongest known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's isn't a part of typical aging. But as you grow older, the chances of getting the disease goes up. One study found that there were four new diagnoses per 1,000 people ages 65 to 74 every year. Among people ages 75 to 84, there were 32 new diagnoses per 1,000 people. For those 85 and older, there were 76 new diagnoses per 1,000 people. Family history and genetics The risk of getting Alzheimer's disease is higher if a first-degree relative such as a parent or sibling was diagnosed with the disease. How genes among families affect the risk is largely not understood. The genetic factors are likely complex. A better understood genetic factor is a form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Having the form of the gene known as APOE e4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. About 25% to 30% of the population carries APOE e4. But not everyone with this form of the gene develops the disease. Having two copies of APOE e4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease more than having one copy. Scientists have found rare changes in three genes that virtually guarantee a person who inherits one of them will develop Alzheimer's. But these changes account for less than 1% of people with Alzheimer's disease. Down syndrome Many people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease. This is likely related to having three copies of chromosome 21. Chromosome 21 is the gene involved in the production of the protein that leads to the creation of beta-amyloid. Beta-amyloid fragments can become plaques in the brain. Symptoms tend to appear 10 to 20 years earlier in people with Down syndrome than they do for the general population. Sex assigned at birth Overall there are more women with the disease because they tend to live longer than men. Mild cognitive impairment Someone with mild cognitive impairment, also called MCI, has a bigger decline in memory or other thinking skills than is usual for the person's age. But the decline doesn't prevent the person from functioning at work or socially. However, people with MCI have a higher risk of getting dementia than are people who don't have mild cognitive impairment. When MCI affects mainly memory, the condition is more likely to progress to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. A diagnosis of MCI offers people the chance to focus on healthy lifestyle changes and to come up with strategies to make up for memory loss. They also can schedule regular healthcare appointments to monitor symptoms. Head injury Several large studies found that people age 50 or older who had a traumatic brain injury, also called TBI, had a higher risk of getting dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The risk is even higher in people with serious TBIs or multiple TBIs. Air pollution Studies in animals have found that air pollution particulates can speed the breakdown of the nervous system. Human studies have found that air pollution exposure — especially from traffic exhaust and burning wood — is linked to a higher risk of dementia. Heavy alcohol use Drinking large amounts of alcohol has long been known to cause brain changes. Several large studies and reviews found that alcohol misuse is linked to a higher risk of dementia, especially early-onset dementia. Poor sleep patterns Research has shown that poor sleep patterns, such as trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, are linked to a raised risk of Alzheimer's disease. Sleep apnea also may raise the risk of dementia. Lifestyle and heart health Research has shown that the same risk factors for heart disease also may increase the risk of dementia. It's not clear if these factors raise risk by worsening Alzheimer's changes in the brain or by leading to blood vessel changes in the brain. The factors include: Lack of exercise.Obesity.Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke.High blood pressure.High cholesterol.Poorly managed type 2 diabetes. High levels of low-density lipoprotein, known as LDL, cholesterol in middle age, in particular, raises the risk of dementia. Research has found that people younger than 65 with high LDL cholesterol levels have a higher risk of dementia. But taking medicines to lower LDL cholesterol didn't raise the risk. These factors can all be modified, so changing lifestyle habits can to some degree alter your risk. For example, regular exercise and a healthy low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables are related to a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Hearing loss Studies have found that people who have hearing loss are at risk of dementia. The worse the hearing loss, the higher the risk. However, wearing hearing aids protects against getting dementia. Vision loss that is not treated Newer research suggests vision loss that isn't treated is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. The link may be due to a disease such as diabetes that can increase the risk of both vision loss and dementia. But some research suggests vision loss itself may increase the risk of dementia. Lifelong learning and social engagement Studies have found that being social and doing activities that stimulate the mind throughout life can lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Low education levels — less than a high school education — appear to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.\", 'premature ovarian failure': 'Factors that raise the risk of primary ovarian insufficiency include: Age.The risk goes up between ages 35 and 40. Primary ovarian insufficiency is rare before age 30. But younger people and even teens can get it.Family history.Having a family history of primary ovarian insufficiency raises the risk of getting this condition.Ovarian surgery.Surgeries that involve the ovaries raise the risk of primary ovarian insufficiency.', 'Thoracic Outlet Syndrome': 'There are several factors that seem to increase the risk of thoracic outlet syndrome, including: Sex.Women are more than three times more likely to be diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome than are men.Age.Thoracic outlet syndrome may occur at any age but is most commonly diagnosed in adults between the ages of 20 and 50.', 'Crohn Disease': \"Risk factors for Crohn's disease may include: Family history.People with a first-degree relative, such as a parent, sibling or child, are at higher risk to have the disease. As many as 1 in 5 people with Crohn's disease has a family member with the disease.Age.Crohn's disease can happen at any age, but it's more common to develop the condition when you're young. Most people who develop Crohn's disease are diagnosed before they're around 30 years old.Ethnicity.Although Crohn's disease can affect any ethnic group, white people have the highest risk, especially people of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent. However, the incidence of Crohn's disease is increasing among Black people who live in North America and the United Kingdom. Crohn's disease also is being increasingly seen in the Middle Eastern population and among migrants to the United States.Cigarette smoking.Cigarette smoking is the most important controllable risk factor for developing Crohn's disease. Smoking also leads to more-serious disease and a greater risk of having surgery. If you smoke, it's important to stop.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines.These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve), diclofenac sodium and others. While they do not cause Crohn's disease, they can lead to inflammation of the bowel that makes Crohn's disease worse.\", 'Atrial Flutter': 'Some health conditions increase the risk of atrial flutter. They include: Heart failure.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also called COPD.Blood clot in the lungs, called a pulmonary embolism.Heart condition present at birth, called a congenital heart defect. Other risk factors for atrial flutter are: Getting older.Recent heart surgery.', 'Tooth Diseases': \"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is hereditary, so you're at higher risk of developing the disorder if anyone in your immediate family has the disease. Other causes of neuropathies, such as diabetes, may cause symptoms similar to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. These other conditions can also cause the symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease to become worse. Medications such as the chemotherapy drugs vincristine (Marqibo), paclitaxel (Abraxane) and others can make symptoms worse. Be sure to let your doctor know about all of the medications you're taking.\", 'Myocardial Infarction': 'Heart attack risk factors include: Age.Men age 45 and older and women age 55 and older are more likely to have a heart attack than are younger men and women. Tobacco use.This includes smoking and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke. If you smoke, quit. High blood pressure.Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that lead to the heart. High blood pressure that occurs with other conditions, such as obesity, high cholesterol or diabetes, increases the risk even more. High cholesterol or triglycerides.A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the \"bad\" cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries. A high level of certain blood fats called triglycerides also increases heart attack risk. Your heart attack risk may drop if levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the \"good\" cholesterol — are in the standard range. Obesity.Obesity is linked with high blood pressure, diabetes, high levels of triglycerides and bad cholesterol, and low levels of good cholesterol. Diabetes.Blood sugar rises when the body doesn\\'t make a hormone called insulin or can\\'t use it correctly. High blood sugar increases the risk of a heart attack. Metabolic syndrome.This is a combination of at least three of the following things: enlarged waist (central obesity), high blood pressure, low good cholesterol, high triglycerides and high blood sugar. Having metabolic syndrome makes you twice as likely to develop heart disease than if you don\\'t have it. Family history of heart attacks.If a brother, sister, parent or grandparent had an early heart attack (by age 55 for males and by age 65 for females), you might be at increased risk. Not enough exercise.A lack of physical activity (sedentary lifestyle) is linked to a higher risk of heart attacks. Regular exercise improves heart health. Unhealthy diet.A diet high in sugars, animal fats, processed foods, trans fats and salt increases the risk of heart attacks. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, fiber and healthy oils. Stress.Emotional stress, such as extreme anger, may increase the risk of a heart attack. Illegal drug use.Cocaine and amphetamines are stimulants. They can trigger a coronary artery spasm that can cause a heart attack. A history of preeclampsia.This condition causes high blood pressure during pregnancy. It increases the lifetime risk of heart disease. An autoimmune condition.Having a condition such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can increase the risk of a heart attack.', 'fracture of the leg': 'Stress fractures are often the result of repetitive stress to the leg bones from physical activities, such as: RunningBallet dancingBasketballMarching Contact sports, such as hockey and football, also may pose a risk of direct blows to the leg, which can result in a fracture.

Cystic fibrosis. Henoch-Schonlein purpura, also known as IgA vasculitis. Crohn's disease. Celiac disease.\", 'arthritis of the hip': \"Factors that can increase your risk of osteoarthritis include: Older age.The risk of osteoarthritis increases with age. Sex assigned at birth.People assigned female at birth are more likely to develop osteoarthritis, though it isn't clear why. Obesity.Carrying extra body weight contributes to osteoarthritis in several ways. The more you weigh, the greater your risk. Increased weight adds stress to weight-bearing joints, such as the hips and knees. Also, fat tissue produces proteins that can cause harmful swelling in and around your joints. Joint injuries.Injuries, such as those that happen when playing sports or from an accident, can increase the risk of osteoarthritis. Even injuries that occurred many years ago can increase the risk of osteoarthritis. Repeated stress on the joint.If a job or sport places repetitive stress on a joint, that joint might develop osteoarthritis someday. Genetics.Some people inherit a tendency to develop osteoarthritis. Bone deformities.Some people are born with malformed joints or defective cartilage. Certain metabolic diseases.These include diabetes and a condition in which your body has too much iron, called hemochromatosis.\", 'Pressure Ulcer': \"Your risk of getting bedsores is higher if you have a hard time moving and can't change position easily while seated or in bed.

If you can't feel pain or discomfort, you won't be aware of warning signs and the need to change position.Poor nutrition and hydration.People need enough fluids, calories, protein, vitamins and minerals every day to maintain healthy skin and stop the breakdown of tissues.Medical conditions affecting blood flow.Health problems that can affect blood flow can raise the risk of tissue damage such as bedsores. Examples of these types of medical conditions are diabetes and vascular disease.Age.If you're over 70, you're more likely to be affected by bedsores.\", 'Chronic ulcer': '', 'Osteoporosis': \"A number of factors can increase the likelihood that you'll develop osteoporosis — including your age, race, lifestyle choices, and medical conditions and treatments. Unchangeable risks Some risk factors for osteoporosis are out of your control, including: Your sex.Women are much more likely to develop osteoporosis than are men.Age.The older you get, the greater your risk of osteoporosis.Race.You're at greatest risk of osteoporosis if you're white or of Asian descent.Family history.Having a parent or sibling with osteoporosis puts you at greater risk, especially if your mother or father fractured a hip.Body frame size.Men and women who have small body frames tend to have a higher risk because they might have less bone mass to draw from as they age. Hormone levels Osteoporosis is more common in people who have too much or too little of certain hormones in their bodies. Examples include: Sex hormones.Lowered sex hormone levels tend to weaken bone. The fall in estrogen levels in women at menopause is one of the strongest risk factors for developing osteoporosis. Treatments for prostate cancer that reduce testosterone levels in men and treatments for breast cancer that reduce estrogen levels in women are likely to accelerate bone loss.Thyroid problems.Too much thyroid hormone can cause bone loss. This can occur if your thyroid is overactive or if you take too much thyroid hormone medicine to treat an underactive thyroid.Other glands.Osteoporosis has also been associated with overactive parathyroid and adrenal glands. Dietary factors Osteoporosis is more likely to occur in people who have: Low calcium intake.A lifelong lack of calcium plays a role in the development of osteoporosis. Low calcium intake contributes to diminished bone density, early bone loss and an increased risk of fractures.Eating disorders.Severely restricting food intake and being underweight weakens bone in both men and women.Gastrointestinal surgery.Surgery to reduce the size of your stomach or to remove part of the intestine limits the amount of surface area available to absorb nutrients, including calcium. These surgeries include those to help you lose weight and for other gastrointestinal disorders. Steroids and other medicines Long-term use of oral or injected corticosteroid medicines, such as prednisone and cortisone, interferes with the bone-rebuilding process. Osteoporosis has also been associated with medications used to combat or prevent: Seizures.Gastric reflux.Cancer.Transplant rejection. Medical problems The risk of osteoporosis is higher in people who have certain medical problems, including: Celiac disease.Inflammatory bowel disease.Kidney or liver disease.Cancer.Multiple myeloma.Rheumatoid arthritis. Lifestyle choices Some bad habits can increase your risk of osteoporosis. Examples include: Sedentary lifestyle.People who spend a lot of time sitting have a higher risk of osteoporosis than do those who are more active. Any weight-bearing exercise and activities that promote balance and good posture are good for your bones, but walking, running, jumping, dancing and weightlifting seem particularly helpful.Excessive alcohol consumption.Regular consumption of more than two alcoholic drinks a day increases the risk of osteoporosis.Tobacco use.The exact role tobacco plays in osteoporosis isn't clear, but it has been shown that tobacco use contributes to weak bones.\", 'Anemia, Sickle Cell': 'For a baby to have sickle cell anemia, both parents must carry a sickle cell gene.

Having a faulty, diseased or damaged heart valve increases the risk of the condition. However, endocarditis may occur in those without heart valve problems. Risk factors for endocarditis include: A typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings. If you're at risk of endocarditis, tell your health care providers. You may want to request an endocarditis wallet card from the American Heart Association. Check with your local chapter or print the card from the association's website. Older age.Endocarditis occurs most often in adults over age 60. Artificial heart valves.Germs are more likely to attach to an artificial (prosthetic) heart valve than to a regular heart valve. Damaged heart valves.Certain medical conditions, such as rheumatic fever or infection, can damage or scar one or more of the heart valves, increasing the risk of infection. A history of endocarditis also increases the risk of infection. Congenital heart defects.Being born with certain types of heart defects, such as an irregular heart or damaged heart valves, raises the risk of heart infections. Implanted heart device.Bacteria can attach to an implanted device, such as a pacemaker, causing an infection of the heart's lining.

Contaminated needles and syringes are a special concern for people who use illegal IV\\xa0drugs, such as heroin or cocaine. Poor dental health.A healthy mouth and healthy gums are essential for good health. If you don't brush and floss regularly, bacteria can grow inside your mouth and may enter your bloodstream through a cut on your gums. Some dental procedures that can cut the gums also may allow bacteria to get in the bloodstream. Long-term catheter use.A catheter is a thin tube that's used to do some medical procedures.

Bacterial meningitis is common in those younger than age 20 years.Living in groups.College students living in dorms, people on military bases, and children in boarding schools and child care facilities are at greater risk of meningococcal meningitis. This is probably because the germ quickly spreads through large groups.Pregnancy.Pregnancy increases the risk of an infection caused by listeria bacteria, which also may cause meningitis. The infection raises the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery.Weakened immune system.AIDS, alcohol use disorder, diabetes, medicines that lower the immune system and other factors that affect the immune system raise the risk of meningitis.

Older and younger age Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes. Living conditions People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu. Weakened immune system An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine. Chronic illnesses Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease. Race or ethnicity In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza. Aspirin therapy Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus. Pregnancy Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters. Obesity People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.\", 'Esophagitis': 'Risk factors for esophagitis vary depending on the cause of the condition. Reflux esophagitis Factors that raise the risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) also are factors in reflux esophagitis. These risk factors include the following: Eating right before going to bed.Eating meals that are too large and fatty.Smoking.Gaining extra weight, including from pregnancy. Foods that can make symptoms of GERD or reflux esophagitis worse include: Caffeine.Alcohol.Fatty foods.Chocolate.Peppermint. Eosinophilic esophagitis Risk factors for this allergy-related esophagitis may include: A history of certain allergic reactions. These include asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever.A family history of eosinophilic esophagitis. Medicine-induced esophagitis Risk factors for this type of esophagitis often are linked with issues that prevent quick and complete passage of a pill into the stomach. These factors include: Swallowing a pill with little or no water.Taking medicines while lying down.Taking medicines right before sleep. This risk factor likely is due in part to less saliva being made and less swallowing happening during sleep.Being older in age. This may be a factor because of age-related changes to the muscles of the esophagus or to glands making less saliva.Taking large or oddly shaped pills. Infectious esophagitis Risk factors for infectious esophagitis often relate to medicines such as steroids or antibiotics. People with diabetes also have a higher risk of esophagitis caused by a fungal candida infection in particular. Other causes of infectious esophagitis may relate to poor immune system function. This may be due to an immune system condition, such as HIV/AIDS, or certain cancers. Also, certain cancer treatments may raise the risk of infectious esophagitis. So might medicines called immunosuppressants that block immune system reactions to transplanted organs.', 'Yeast infection': \"Factors that raise the risk of getting a yeast infection include: Antibiotic use.Yeast infections are common in people who take antibiotics. Broad-spectrum antibiotics kill a range of bacteria. They also kill healthy bacteria in the vagina. This can lead to too much yeast.Raised estrogen levels.Yeast infections are more common in people with higher estrogen levels. Pregnancy, birth control pills and hormone therapy can raise estrogen levels.Diabetes that isn't well-managed.People with poorly managed blood sugar are at greater risk of yeast infections than are people with well-managed blood sugar.Weakened immune system.People with lowered immunity are more likely to get yeast infections. Lower immunity might be from corticosteroid therapy or HIV infection or other diseases that suppress the immune system.\", 'Spina Bifida': \"Spina bifida is more common among Hispanic people and white people. Also, female babies are affected more often than male babies. Although healthcare professionals and researchers don't know why spina bifida occurs, they have identified some risk factors: Too little folate in the pregnant person's body.Folate, the natural form of vitamin B-9, is important to the development of a healthy baby. Folic acid is the synthetic form that's found in supplements and fortified foods. If folate levels are too low, it's known as a deficiency. Folate deficiency increases the risk of spina bifida and other conditions that affect the neural tube.Family history of neural tube defects.Having one child with a condition that affects the neural tube slightly increases the chance of having another baby with the same condition. The risk increases even more if two previous children have been affected by the condition.Also, being born with a neural tube defect increases the chance of giving birth to a child with spina bifida. However, most babies with spina bifida are born to parents with no known family history of the condition.Some medicines.Taking anti-seizure medicines such as valproic acid during pregnancy increases the risk of having a baby with spina bifida. This might happen because the medicines interfere with the body's ability to use folate and folic acid.Diabetes.Having diabetes that is not well controlled before becoming pregnant increases the risk of having a baby with spina bifida.Obesity.Obesity at the time of pregnancy also is associated with an increased risk of spina bifida.Increased body temperature.Some evidence suggests that increased body temperature in the early weeks of pregnancy may increase the risk of spina bifida. A high core body temperature can be caused by a fever or by using a sauna or hot tub. If you have known risk factors for spina bifida, talk with your healthcare professional. You may need a larger dose or prescription dose of folic acid, even before a pregnancy begins. Also tell your healthcare professional about all of the medicines you take. If you plan ahead, some medicines can be adjusted to lower the potential risk of spina bifida.\", 'Diverticulitis': 'Diverticulitis is more common among people over 50. Other factors that increase the risk of diverticulitis include: Obesity.Smoking.A diet of low-fiber foods.A diet high in red meat.Heavy alcohol use.Lack of exercise.Low vitamin D levels.Certain medicines, such as steroids, opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve).', 'Moyamoya Disease': \"Though the cause of moyamoya disease is not known, certain factors may increase your risk of having the condition. They include: Asian heritage.Although moyamoya disease is found all over the world, it's more common in East Asian countries, especially Korea, Japan and China. This may be due to certain genetic factors in those populations. People with Asian heritage living in Western countries also have a higher risk of moyamoya disease.Family history of moyamoya disease.If you have a family member with moyamoya disease, your risk of having the condition is 30 to 40 times higher than that of the general population. This strongly suggests a genetic link.Medical conditions.Moyamoya syndrome sometimes happens with other disorders, including neurofibromatosis type 1, sickle cell disease and Down syndrome, among many others.Being female.Moyamoya disease is slightly more common in females.Being young.Though adults can have moyamoya disease, children younger than 15 years old are most commonly affected.\", 'Heat Exhaustion': \"Anyone can get heat illness, but certain factors increase your sensitivity to heat. They include: Young age or old age.Infants and children younger than 4 and adults older than 65 are at higher risk of heat exhaustion. The body's ability to regulate its temperature isn't fully developed in children. In older adults, illness, medicines or other factors can affect the body's ability to control temperature.Certain drugs.Some medicines can affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond properly to heat. These include some medicines used to treat high blood pressure and heart problems (beta blockers, diuretics), reduce allergy symptoms (antihistamines), calm you (tranquilizers), or reduce psychiatric symptoms such as delusions (antipsychotics). Some illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can increase your core temperature.Obesity.Carrying excess weight can affect your body's ability to regulate its temperature and cause your body to keep more heat.Sudden temperature changes.If you're not used to the heat, you're more susceptible to heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion. The body needs time to get used to higher temperatures. Traveling to a warm climate from a cold one or living in an area that experiences an early heat wave can put you at risk of a heat-related illness. The body hasn't had a chance to get used to the higher temperatures.A high heat index.The heat index is a single temperature value that considers how both the outdoor temperature and humidity make you feel. When the humidity is high, your sweat can't evaporate as easily, and your body has more trouble cooling itself. This makes you more prone to heat exhaustion and heatstroke. When the heat index is 91 F (33 C) or higher, you should take precautions to keep cool.\", 'Frostbite': 'Risk factors for frostbite include: Being in freezing conditions without protective clothing.Having certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, exhaustion, poor blood flow or congestive heart failure.Regularly smoking tobacco.Having impaired judgment while in very cold conditions.Having had frostbite or another cold injury in the past.Being an infant or older adult in cold conditions.

It's located on one of the nonsex chromosomes, called autosomes. Only one changed gene is needed for someone to be affected by this type of condition. A person with an autosomal dominant condition — in this example, the father — has a 50% chance of having an affected child with one changed gene and a 50% chance of having an unaffected child. Known risk factors for essential tremor include: Altered gene.The inherited variety of essential tremor, known as familial tremor, is an autosomal dominant disorder. That means an altered gene from just one parent is needed to pass on the condition.Anyone who has a parent with an altered gene for essential tremor has a 50% chance of developing the condition.Age.Essential tremor is more common in people age 40 and older.\", 'Down Syndrome': 'Some parents have a greater risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. Risk factors include: Older age.Chances of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome goes up with age because older eggs have a greater risk of unusual chromosome division. The risk of having a child with Down syndrome increases after a pregnant person is 35 years of age. But most children with Down syndrome are born to pregnant people under age 35 because they have far more babies.Being carriers of the genetic translocation for Down syndrome.Either parent can pass the genetic translocation for Down syndrome on to their children.Having had one child with Down syndrome.Both parents who have one child with Down syndrome and parents who have a translocation themselves are at higher risk of having another child with Down syndrome. A genetic counselor can help parents understand the risk of having a second child with Down syndrome.', 'Pneumothorax': 'In general, men are far more likely to have a pneumothorax than women are. The type of pneumothorax caused by ruptured air blisters is most likely to occur in people between 20 and 40 years old, especially if the person is very tall and underweight.

Having an artificial joint.Bacteria can be introduced during joint replacement surgery, or an artificial joint may become infected if germs travel to the joint from a different area of the body through the bloodstream. Taking medications for rheumatoid arthritis.People with rheumatoid arthritis have a further increase in risk because of medications they take that can suppress the immune system, making infections more likely to occur. Diagnosing septic arthritis in people with rheumatoid arthritis is difficult because many of the signs and symptoms are similar. Skin fragility.Skin that breaks easily and heals poorly can give bacteria access to your body. Skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema increase your risk of septic arthritis, as do infected skin wounds. People who regularly inject drugs also have a higher risk of infection at the site of injection. Weak immune system.People with a weak immune system are at greater risk of septic arthritis.

Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.Certain types of birth control.Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk ofUTIs. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.Menopause.After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk ofUTIs. Other risk factors forUTIs include: Urinary tract problems.Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can causeUTIs.Blockages in the urinary tract.Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk ofUTIs is higher.A suppressed immune system.Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk ofUTIs.Catheter use.People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk ofUTIs. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital.

Steroid use.Use of high-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone, is a common cause of avascular necrosis. The reason is unknown, but some experts believe that corticosteroids can increase lipid levels in the blood, reducing blood flow. Drinking too much alcohol.Having several alcoholic drinks a day for several years also can cause fatty deposits to form in blood vessels. Bisphosphonate use.Long-term use of medications to increase bone density might contribute to developing osteonecrosis of the jaw.

However, only some people with the infection develop gastritis or other upper gastrointestinal disorders. Healthcare professionals believe sensitivity to the germs could be inherited. Sensitivity also may be caused by lifestyle choices, such as smoking and diet.Regular use of pain relievers.Pain relievers known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs, can cause both acute gastritis and chronic gastritis. NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox DS). Using these pain relievers regularly or taking too much of these medicines may damage the stomach lining.Older age.Older adults have an increased risk of gastritis because the stomach lining tends to thin with age. Older adults also have an increased risk because they are more likely to have H. pylori infection or autoimmune disorders than younger people are.Excessive alcohol use.Alcohol can irritate and break down your stomach lining. This makes your stomach more vulnerable to digestive juices. Excessive alcohol use is more likely to cause acute gastritis.Stress.Severe stress due to major surgery, injury, burns or severe infections can cause acute gastritis.Cancer treatment.Chemotherapy medicines or radiation treatment can increase your risk of gastritis.Your own body attacking cells in your stomach.Called autoimmune gastritis, this type of gastritis occurs when your body attacks the cells that make up your stomach lining.

Medical conditions and treatments Some medical conditions and treatments put you at risk, such as: Heart disease.Heart and blood vessel disease, specifically heart failure, makes clot formation more likely.Cancer.Certain cancers — especially brain, ovary, pancreas, colon, stomach, lung and kidney cancers, and cancers that have spread — can increase the risk of blood clots. Chemotherapy further increases the risk. You also have a higher risk of blood clots if you have a personal or family history of breast cancer and are taking tamoxifen or raloxifene (Evista).Surgery.Surgery is one of the leading causes of problem blood clots. For this reason, medicine to prevent clots may be given before and after major surgery, such as joint replacement.Disorders that affect clotting.Some inherited disorders affect blood, making it more likely to clot. Other medical disorders such as kidney disease also can increase the risk of blood clots.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).People who have severe symptoms ofCOVID-19have an increased risk of pulmonary embolism. Extended periods of inactivity Blood clots are more likely to form during longer than usual periods of inactivity, such as: Bed rest.Being confined to bed for an extended period after surgery, a heart attack, leg fracture, trauma or any serious illness puts you at risk of blood clots. When your legs lie flat for long periods of time, the flow of blood through your veins slows down and blood can pool in your legs. This sometimes can result in blood clots.Long trips.Sitting in a cramped position during lengthy plane or car trips slows blood flow in the legs, which increases the risk of blood clots. Other risk factors Smoking.For reasons that aren't well understood, tobacco use increases the risk of blood clots in some people, especially those who have other risk factors.Being overweight.Excess weight increases the risk of blood clots — particularly in people with other risk factors.Supplemental estrogen.The estrogen in birth control pills and in hormone replacement therapy can increase clotting factors in the blood, especially in those who smoke or are overweight.Pregnancy.The weight of a baby pressing on veins in the pelvis can slow blood return from the legs.

Smoking.Smoking has been linked to increased neck pain.', 'Hepatitis B': \"You're at increased risk of hepatitis A if you: Travel or work in areas of the world where hepatitis A is commonLive with another person who has hepatitis AAre a man who has sexual contact with other menHave any type of sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis AAreHIVpositiveAre homelessUse any type of recreational drugs, not just those that are injected\", 'Hepatitis C': \"You're at increased risk of hepatitis A if you: Travel or work in areas of the world where hepatitis A is commonLive with another person who has hepatitis AAre a man who has sexual contact with other menHave any type of sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis AAreHIVpositiveAre homelessUse any type of recreational drugs, not just those that are injected\", 'Hepatitis D Infection': \"You're at increased risk of hepatitis A if you: Travel or work in areas of the world where hepatitis A is commonLive with another person who has hepatitis AAre a man who has sexual contact with other menHave any type of sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis AAreHIVpositiveAre homelessUse any type of recreational drugs, not just those that are injected\", 'Hepatitis E': \"You're at increased risk of hepatitis A if you: Travel or work in areas of the world where hepatitis A is commonLive with another person who has hepatitis AAre a man who has sexual contact with other menHave any type of sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis AAreHIVpositiveAre homelessUse any type of recreational drugs, not just those that are injected\", 'Hepatitis, Alcoholic': \"The major risk factor for alcoholic hepatitis is the how much alcohol you drink. It isn't known how much alcohol it takes to cause alcoholic hepatitis. Most people with this condition have had at least seven drinks a day for 20 years or more. This can mean 7 glasses of wine, 7 beers, or 7 shots of spirits. However, alcoholic hepatitis can happen to people who drink less and have other risk factors, including: Sex.Women seem to have a higher risk of getting alcoholic hepatitis. That might be because of how alcohol breaks down in women's bodies.Obesity.Heavy drinkers who are overweight might be more likely to get alcoholic hepatitis. And they might be more likely to go on to get liver scarring.Genes.Studies suggest that genes might be involved in alcohol-induced liver disease.Race and ethnicity.Black and Hispanic people might be at higher risk of alcoholic hepatitis.Binge drinking.Having five or more drinks in about two hours for men and four or more for women might increase the risk of alcoholic hepatitis.\", 'Varicose Veins': \"The two main risk factors for varicose veins are: Family history.If other family members have varicose veins, there's a greater chance you will too.Obesity.Being overweight puts added pressure on veins. Other things that might increase the risk of varicose veins include: Age.Aging causes wear and tear on the valves in the veins that help control blood flow. Over time, that wear causes the valves to allow some blood to flow back into the veins, where it collects.Sex.Women are more likely to get the condition. Hormones tend to relax vein walls. So changes in hormones before a menstrual period or during pregnancy or menopause might be a factor. Hormone treatments, such as birth control pills, might increase the risk of varicose veins.Pregnancy.During pregnancy, the blood volume in the body increases. This change supports the growing baby but also can make the veins in the legs bigger.Standing or sitting for long periods of time.Movement helps blood flow.\", 'Hyperthyroidism': \"Risk factors for hyperthyroidism include: A family history of thyroid disease, particularly Graves' disease.A personal history of certain chronic illnesses, including pernicious anemia and primary adrenal insufficiency.A recent pregnancy, which raises the risk of developing thyroiditis. This can lead to hyperthyroidism.\", 'Arthritis': 'Several factors can increase your risk of psoriatic arthritis, including: In some cases, psoriasis can cause pitted and deformed nails that are thickened and discolored. Nails may also separate from the nail bed. Psoriasis.Having psoriasis is the single greatest risk factor for developing psoriatic arthritis. Family history.Many people with psoriatic arthritis have a parent or a sibling with the disease. Age.Although anyone can develop psoriatic arthritis, it occurs most often in adults between the ages of 30 and 55.', 'Vertigo': 'Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo occurs most often in people age 50 and older, but can occur at any age.BPPVis also more common in women than in men. A head injury or any other disorder of the balance organs of your ear may make you more susceptible toBPPV.', 'accident cerebrovascular': \"Many factors can increase the risk of stroke. Potentially treatable stroke risk factors include: Lifestyle risk factors Being overweight or obese.Physical inactivity.Heavy or binge drinking.Use of illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine. Medical risk factors High blood pressure.Cigarette smoking or secondhand smoke exposure.High cholesterol.Diabetes.Obstructive sleep apnea.Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, heart defects, heart infection or irregular heart rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation.Personal or family history of stroke, heart attack or transient ischemic attack.COVID-19infection. Other factors associated with a higher risk of stroke include: Age— People age 55 or older have a higher risk of stroke than do younger people.Race or ethnicity— African American and Hispanic people have a higher risk of stroke than do people of other races or ethnicities.Sex— Men have a higher risk of stroke than do women. Women are usually older when they have strokes, and they're more likely to die of strokes than are men.Hormones— Taking birth control pills or hormone therapies that include estrogen can increase risk.\", 'infection': 'Risk factors for pinworm infection include: Being young.Pinworm infections are most likely to occur in children ages 5 to 10. The tiny (microscopic) eggs are easily spread to family members, caregivers, or other children at school or child care centers. Pinworm infections are uncommon in children younger than age 2. Living in crowded spaces.People who live in institutions are at higher risk of developing pinworm infections.', 'infection urinary tract': \"UTIs are common in women. Many women experience more than oneUTIduring their lifetimes. Risk factors forUTIs that are specific to women include: Female anatomy.Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.Sexual activity.Being sexually active tends to lead to moreUTIs. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.Certain types of birth control.Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk ofUTIs. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.Menopause.After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk ofUTIs. Other risk factors forUTIs include: Urinary tract problems.Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can causeUTIs.Blockages in the urinary tract.Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk ofUTIs is higher.A suppressed immune system.Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk ofUTIs.Catheter use.People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk ofUTIs. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.A recent urinary procedure.Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing aUTI.\", 'Confusion': \"Any condition that results in a hospital stay increases the risk of delirium. This is mostly true when someone is recovering from surgery or is put in intensive care. Delirium is more common in older adults and in people who live in nursing homes. Examples of other conditions that may increase the risk of delirium include: Brain disorders such as dementia, stroke or Parkinson's diseasePast delirium episodesVision or hearing lossMultiple medical problems\", 'Cellulitis': \"Several factors put you at increased risk of cellulitis: Injury.Any cut, fracture, burn or scrape gives bacteria an entry point. Weakened immune system.Conditions that weaken the immune system increase the risk of infection. Examples are diabetes, leukemia and HIV/AIDS. Certain medicines also can weaken the immune system. Skin conditions.Conditions such as atopic dermatitis — also called eczema — athlete's foot and shingles can cause breaks in the skin and give bacteria an entry point. Long-term swelling of the arms or legs.This condition is called lymphedema. It sometimes happens after surgery. History of cellulitis.Having had cellulitis before increases the risk of getting it again. Being overweight.Excess weight increases the risk of developing cellulitis.\", 'Deep Vein Thrombosis': \"Many things can increase the risk of developing DVT. The more risk factors you have, the greater your risk of DVT. Risk factors for DVT\\xa0include: Sometimes, a blood clot in a vein can occur with no identifiable risk factor. This is called an unprovoked\\xa0venous thromboembolism. Age.Being older than 60 increases the risk of DVT. But DVT\\xa0can occur at any age. Lack of movement.When the legs don't move for a long time, the calf muscles don't squeeze (contract). Muscle contractions help blood flow. Sitting for a long time, such as when driving or flying, increases the risk of DVT. So does long-term bed rest, which may result from a lengthy hospital stay or a medical condition such as paralysis. Injury or surgery.Injury to the veins or surgery can increase the risk of blood clots. Pregnancy.Pregnancy increases the pressure in the veins in the pelvis and legs. The risk of blood clots from pregnancy can continue for up to six weeks after a baby is born. People with an inherited clotting disorder are especially at risk. Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) or hormone replacement therapy.Both can increase the blood's ability to clot. Being overweight or obese.Being overweight increases the pressure in the veins in the pelvis and legs. Smoking.Smoking affects how blood flows and clots, which can increase the risk of DVT. Cancer.Some cancers increase substances in the blood that cause the blood to clot. Some types of cancer treatment also increase the risk of blood clots. Heart failure.Heart failure increases the risk of DVT\\xa0and pulmonary embolism. Because the heart and lungs don't work well in people with heart failure, the symptoms caused by even a small pulmonary embolism are more noticeable. Inflammatory bowel disease.Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis increase the risk of DVT. A personal or family history of DVT\\xa0or\\xa0pulmonary embolism (PE).If you or someone in your family has had one or both of these conditions, you might be at greater risk of developing DVT. Genetics.Some people have DNA changes that cause the blood to clot more easily. One example is factor V Leiden. This inherited disorder changes one of the clotting factors in the blood. An inherited disorder on its own might not cause blood clots unless combined with other risk factors.\", 'Dehydration': \"Anyone can get dehydrated. But certain people are at greater risk. They include: Adding to these problems can be illnesses such as diabetes and dementia and taking certain medicines. Some older people might not be able to get water for themselves. Infants and children.This group is most likely to have bad diarrhea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration. They also lose a lot of fluids from high fevers or burns. Young children often can't say that they're thirsty. Nor can they get a drink for themselves. Older adults.With aging, the body's fluid reserve becomes smaller. The ability to hold on to water is reduced. And older people are less likely to feel thirsty.\", 'Neoplasms': 'Factors that can increase your risk of myelodysplastic syndromes include: Older age.Most people with myelodysplastic syndromes are older than 60.Previous treatment with chemotherapy or radiation.Chemotherapy or radiation therapy, both of which are commonly used to treat cancer, can increase your risk of myelodysplastic syndromes.Exposure to certain chemicals.Chemicals, including benzene, have been linked to myelodysplastic syndromes.', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic': 'Factors that can increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include: DiabetesHigh blood pressureHeart (cardiovascular) diseaseSmokingObesityBeing Black, Native American or Asian AmericanFamily history of kidney diseaseAbnormal kidney structureOlder ageFrequent use of medications that can damage the kidneys', 'carcinoma': \"Several factors may increase the risk of ductal carcinoma in situ, also called DCIS. DCIS is an early form of breast cancer. Risk factors for breast cancer may include: A family history of breast cancer.If a parent, sibling or child had breast cancer, your risk of breast cancer is increased. The risk is higher if your family has a history of getting breast cancer at a young age. The risk also is higher if you have multiple family members with breast cancer. Still, most people diagnosed with breast cancer don't have a family history of the disease.A personal history of breast cancer.If you've had cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of getting cancer in the other breast.A personal history of breast conditions.Certain breast conditions are a sign of a higher risk of breast cancer. These conditions include lobular carcinoma in situ, also called LCIS, and atypical hyperplasia of the breast. If you've had a breast biopsy that found one of these conditions, you have an increased risk of breast cancer.Beginning your period at a younger age.Beginning your period before age 12 increases the risk of breast cancer.Beginning menopause at an older age.Beginning menopause after age 55 increases the risk of breast cancer.Being female.Women are much more likely than men are to get breast cancer. Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer.Dense breast tissue.Breast tissue is made up of fatty tissue and dense tissue. Dense tissue is made of milk glands, milk ducts and fibrous tissue. If you have dense breasts, you have more dense tissue than fatty tissue in your breasts. Having dense breasts can make it harder to detect breast cancer on a mammogram. If a mammogram showed that you have dense breasts, your risk of breast cancer is increased. Talk with your healthcare team about other tests you might have in addition to mammograms to look for breast cancer.Drinking alcohol.Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer.Having your first child at an older age.Giving birth to your first child after age 30 may increase the risk of breast cancer.Having never been pregnant.Having been pregnant one or more times lowers the risk of breast cancer. Never having been pregnant increases the risk.Increasing age.The risk of breast cancer goes up as you get older.Inherited DNA changes that increase cancer risk.Certain DNA changes that increase the risk of breast cancer can be passed from parents to children. The most well-known changes are called BRCA1 and BRCA2. These changes can greatly increase your risk of breast cancer and other cancers, but not everyone with these DNA changes gets cancer.Menopausal hormone therapy.Taking certain hormone therapy medicines to control the symptoms of menopause may increase the risk of breast cancer. The risk is linked to hormone therapy medicines that combine estrogen and progesterone. The risk goes down when you stop taking these medicines.Obesity.People with obesity have an increased risk of breast cancer.Radiation exposure.If you received radiation treatments to your chest as a child or young adult, your risk of breast cancer is higher.\", 'Ischemia': 'Factors that can increase your risk of developing myocardial ischemia include: Tobacco.Smoking and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke can damage the inside walls of arteries. The damage can allow deposits of cholesterol and other substances to collect and slow blood flow in the coronary arteries. Smoking causes the coronary arteries to spasm and may also increase the risk of blood clots. Diabetes.Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are linked to an increased risk of myocardial ischemia, heart attack and other heart problems. High blood pressure.Over time, high blood pressure can accelerate atherosclerosis, resulting in damage to the coronary arteries. High blood cholesterol level.Cholesterol is a major part of the deposits that can narrow your coronary arteries. A high level of \"bad\" (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) cholesterol in your blood may be due to an inherited condition or a diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol. High blood triglyceride level.Triglycerides, another type of blood fat, also may contribute to atherosclerosis. Obesity.Obesity is associated with diabetes, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol levels. Waist circumference.A waist measurement of more than 35 inches (89 centimeters) for women and 40 inches (102 cm) in men increases the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Lack of physical activity.Not getting enough exercise contributes to obesity and is linked to higher cholesterol and triglyceride levels. People who get regular aerobic exercise have better heart health, which is associated with a lower risk of myocardial ischemia and heart attack. Exercise also reduces blood pressure.', 'kidney failure acute': \"Acute kidney injury almost always is linked to another medical condition or event. Conditions that can increase your risk of acute kidney injury include: Ongoing kidney disease, also called chronic kidney disease.Older age, but it does happen to children.Being in the hospital, most often for a serious condition that needs intensive care.Blockages in the blood vessels in your arms or legs, called peripheral artery disease.Diabetes, especially if it's not controlled.High blood pressure.Heart failure.Liver diseases.Certain cancers and their treatments.\", 'arthritis': 'Several factors can increase your risk of psoriatic arthritis, including: In some cases, psoriasis can cause pitted and deformed nails that are thickened and discolored.

Family history.Many people with psoriatic arthritis have a parent or a sibling with the disease. Age.Although anyone can develop psoriatic arthritis, it occurs most often in adults between the ages of 30 and 55.', 'Bronchitis': 'Factors that increase your risk of bronchitis include: Cigarette smoke.People who smoke or who live with a smoker are at higher risk of both acute bronchitis and chronic bronchitis.Low resistance.This may result from another acute illness, such as a cold, or from a chronic condition that compromises your immune system. Older adults, infants and young children have greater vulnerability to infection.Exposure to irritants on the job.Your risk of developing bronchitis is greater if you work around certain lung irritants, such as grains or textiles, or are exposed to chemical fumes.Gastric reflux.Repeated bouts of severe heartburn can irritate your throat and make you more prone to developing bronchitis.', 'Pancreatitis': 'Factors that increase your risk of pancreatitis include: Excessive alcohol use.Research shows that having four or five drinks a day increases the risk of pancreatitis.Cigarette smoking.Compared with nonsmokers, smokers are on average three times more likely to develop chronic pancreatitis. Quitting smoking can decrease the risk.Obesity.People with a body mass index of 30 or higher are at increased risk of pancreatitis.Diabetes.Having diabetes increases the risk of pancreatitis.Family history of pancreatitis.A number of genes have been linked to chronic pancreatitis. A family history of the disease is linked to an increased risk, especially when combined with other risk factors.', 'Incontinence': \"A number of factors may increase your risk of developing fecal incontinence, including: Age.Fecal incontinence is more likely in adults over 65.Sex.Fecal incontinence is more common in women, likely because of possible injuries during delivery. Hormone treatments for menopause also may increase the risk.Diseases of the digestive system.The risk of fecal incontinence is increased with long-term diseases that affect the intestines. These include:Inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease.Irritable bowel syndrome.Celiac disease.Mental disability.A mental disability or dementia may affect a person's ability to plan to use the toilet or be aware of the need to use the toilet.Physical disability.A physical disability or limited mobility may make it difficult to reach a toilet in time. An injury that caused a physical disability may cause nerve or muscle damage that increases the risk of fecal incontinence.Lifestyle factors.Lifestyle factors that increase the risk of incontinence include being overweight, not being active, smoking, and drinking caffeinated and alcoholic beverages.\", 'Hernia': 'Hiatal hernias are most common in people who are: Age 50 or older.Obese.', 'Pulmonary Edema': \"Heart failure and other heart conditions that raise pressure in the heart increase the risk of pulmonary edema. Risk factors for heart failure include: Some nervous system conditions and lung damage due to near drowning, drug use, inhaling smoke, viral illnesses and blood clots also raise the risk. People who travel to high-altitude locations above 8,000 feet (about 2,400 meters) are more likely to develop high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). It usually affects those who don't take the time — a few days to a week or more — to get used to the elevation. Children who already have pulmonary hypertension and structural heart defects may be more likely to get HAPE. Irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias) Alcohol use Congenital heart disease Coronary artery disease Diabetes Heart valve disease High blood pressure Sleep apnea\", 'stenosis aortic valve': 'Risk factors of aortic valve stenosis include: Older age.Some heart conditions present at birth, called congenital heart defects.

Ischemic colitis that happens in a young adult may be a sign of a blood-clotting issue. It also may be due to inflammation of the blood vessels, also known as vasculitis.Sex.Ischemic colitis is more common in women.Clotting problems.Conditions that affect the way the blood clots, such as factor V Leiden or sickle cell disease, may increase the risk of ischemic colitis.High cholesterol,which can lead to atherosclerosis.Reduced blood flow,due to heart failure, low blood pressure or shock. Blood flow also can be affected by certain conditions, including diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.Previous abdominal surgery.Scar tissue that forms after surgery may cause reduced blood flow.Heavy exercise,such as marathon running, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the colon.Surgeryinvolving the heart, digestive or gynecological systems.', 'Hyperglycemia': \"Many factors can contribute to hyperglycemia, including: Illness or stress can trigger hyperglycemia. That's because hormones your body makes to fight illness or stress can also cause blood sugar to rise. You may need to take extra diabetes medication to keep blood glucose in your target range during illness or stress. Not using enough insulin or other diabetes medication Not injecting insulin properly or using expired insulin Not following your diabetes eating plan Being inactive Having an illness or infection Using certain medications, such as steroids or immunosuppressants Being injured or having surgery Experiencing emotional stress, such as family problems or workplace issues\", 'Encephalopathies': 'Repeated exposure to traumatic brain injury is thought to increase the risk ofCTE. Experts are still learning about the risk factors.', 'Candidiasis': \"Factors that raise the risk of getting a yeast infection include: Antibiotic use.Yeast infections are common in people who take antibiotics. Broad-spectrum antibiotics kill a range of bacteria. They also kill healthy bacteria in the vagina. This can lead to too much yeast.Raised estrogen levels.Yeast infections are more common in people with higher estrogen levels. Pregnancy, birth control pills and hormone therapy can raise estrogen levels.Diabetes that isn't well-managed.People with poorly managed blood sugar are at greater risk of yeast infections than are people with well-managed blood sugar.Weakened immune system.People with lowered immunity are more likely to get yeast infections. Lower immunity might be from corticosteroid therapy or HIV infection or other diseases that suppress the immune system.\", 'Neuropathy': \"Factors that might increase your risk of autonomic neuropathy include: Diabetes.Diabetes, especially when poorly controlled, increases your risk of autonomic neuropathy and other nerve damage.

In most people with the condition, symptoms start after age 40. Factors that increase your risk of developing emphysema include: Smoking.Smoking cigarettes or having smoked in the past is the biggest risk factor for emphysema. But people who smoke cigars, pipes or marijuana also are at risk. The risk for all types of smokers increases with the number of years of smoking and the amount of tobacco smoked.Being around secondhand smoke.Secondhand smoke is smoke that you breathe in from someone else's cigarette, pipe or cigar. Being around secondhand smoke raises your risk of emphysema.Job exposure to fumes, vapors or dust.If you breathe in fumes or vapors from certain chemicals or dust from grain, cotton, wood or mining products, you're more likely to develop emphysema. This risk is even greater if you also smoke.Exposure to indoor and outdoor pollution.Breathing indoor pollutants, such as fumes from heating fuel, as well as outdoor pollutants, such as smog or car exhaust, increases your risk of emphysema.Genetics.The uncommon condition called AAT deficiency raises the risk of emphysema. Other genetic factors may make certain smokers more likely to get emphysema.\", 'Aphasia': '', 'effusion pericardial': '', 'influenza': 'The risk of a human catching a bird flu is low. Contact with sick poultry or their environment is the most common bird flu risk for people. Infected birds can spread the virus through their breath, saliva, mucus or stool.

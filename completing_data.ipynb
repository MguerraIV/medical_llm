    "A maioria dos dados da base foram enriquecidos com nlp para gerar descrição das doenças e um web scrapping do ste Mayo Clinic para extrair fatores de risco da doença. Entretanto, ainda existem dados faltantes que devem ser preenchidos. Para isso, decidi utilizar o modelo de LLM BioGPT para completar sinteticamente os dados, esse modelo foi desenvolvido pela Microsoft Research especificamente para tarefas biomédicas. Ele segue a arquitetura dos Transformers (GPT-style), mas foi treinado exclusivamente com textos biomédicos, como artigos do PubMed, abstracts científicos e literatura médica especializada. \n",
